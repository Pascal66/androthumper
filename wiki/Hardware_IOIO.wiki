#summary Using the IOIO.

= IOIO =

The IOIO is the device that makes this project come alive. While it would have been equally possible using an Arduino or something similar, using a IOIO allows me to use Java to program is processing loop, and lets me use all of the advantages of the Android operating system, such as internet access, accelerometer/GPS sensors, and camera. 

Using Java for the program loop is much more powerful than using C in Arduino, proving access to any Java library that is compatible with Android.

My IOIO is on the latest bootloader (allowing BlueTooth connection options) and the latest application library.

  * Wild Thumper Controller:
    * The WTC is connected via UART, allowing sending and receiving on two wires. 
    * Pins:
      * *RX*        : 7
      * *TX*        : 6
      * *BAUD*      : 9600
      * *PARITY*    : None
      * *STOP BITS* : One
