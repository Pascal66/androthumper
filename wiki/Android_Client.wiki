#summary The android client that manages the IOIO.

= Android Client =

The Android Client is a heavily threaded application designed to interact with a connected IOIO, receive commands from bluetooth Zeemotes or a connected server, and act upon them or forward them to the IOIO.

AndroThumper can be driven around and controlled without an internet connection by connecting two Zeemotes. <screenshot> Each Zeemote then commands each side of motors with the joysticks.

== Managers ==

To manage the multiple threads and drivers in AndroThumper there is the concept of [http://code.google.com/p/androthumper/wiki/Android_Client_Managers Managers]. Each manager is responsible for holding instances of each of the objects it is managing, such as the ThreadManager holds the camera thread, and the DriverManager holds the WaypointDriver. The Managers provide a way for the Threads to call each others methods. The DriverManager has an instance of the ThreadManager, and allows the drivers to control the threads, for example, allowing the WaypointDriver to control the IOIOThread.
