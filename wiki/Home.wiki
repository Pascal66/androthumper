=Introduction=

AndroThumper is robotics chassis and hardware controller controlled via a IOIO. It can use bluetooth zeemotes to drive, or it can accept command packets from a server. It can send back a camera feed to the server, along with sensor details from the accelerometer and GPS engine.  


===Robot Details===
The robot is based of a 6WD Wild Thumper chassis. It uses a Pololu 2s12v10 to drive the motors, and a IOIO to talk to the phone. Its powered by one or more 7.2v RC car batteries.

===Client Details=== 
The client should run on any Android device. It sends packets to the server containing image slices, sensor information, and GPS/Location information. It receives packets from the server to control its features, such as enabling the camera feed, and to send commands to the motor driver to make it move.

===Server Details=== 
The server is written in Java using Swing for a GUI. It listens on ports 9000 to 9005. It can listen to controller event from XBox 360 controllers and forward this information to the phone to drive it. It has check boxes to enable certain features.

It uses a mapping library from Unfolding Maps (todo link) to provide an easy way to display routing and position information

Private TODO:
NEED COMPASS.
implement sending a list of waypoints. Use codes for new_list [], insert_at [points][locations],restart,stop,pause,resume,go
write server methods to draw waypoints on map, perhaps allow creating route with mouse, click 2 points then again to insert, show current location on map, track phone over waypoints.
write 'driver' threads for things like navigation/exploration/autonomy.
